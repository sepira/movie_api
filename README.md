## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
### Prerequisites
```
You will need to have Python with Virtualenv and Git installed on your machine.
This guide also assumes you are in a Windows environment.

### Installing

First clone the application code into any directory on your disk:
```
> cd /path/to/my/workspace/

Create a virtual Python environment in a directory named venv, activate the virtualenv and install required dependencies using pip:
```
> virtualenv venv
> venv\Scripts\activate
(venv) > pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Now letâ€™s set up the app for development and start it:
```

In your browser, open the URL http://localhost:8888/api/
